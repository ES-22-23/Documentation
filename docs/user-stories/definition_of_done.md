# Definition of Done

## General Definition

The definition of done (DoD) is when all conditions that a software product must satisfy are met and ready to be accepted by a user, customer, team, or consuming system.

It is highly important to ensure all team members stay on the same page, with complete knowledge and transparency of what is expected of them with each delivery. The team members (working on the sprint increment) must apply the Definition of Done at all times.

Many benefits come from applying this definition, such as limiting the cost of rework and limiting the risk of misunderstanding and conflict between the development team and the customer or product owner.

If a Product Backlog item (*User Story) doesn't meet the **Definition of Done**, it wonâ€™t be released or presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it's returned to the Product Backlog for future consideration.

## User Stories Definition

The definition of done (DoD) is when all the criteria defined for the conclusion of a user story is met. This obligatorily means that the Product Owner reviewed and accepted the user story.

## Mandatory Criteria

- Product Owner accepts the User Story
- Acceptance criteria met
- Unit and functional tests passed
- Code reviewed (Peer code review)
- No build fails

## Optional Criteria

- Non-Functional requirements met
- Integrated into a clean build
- No errors in coding standards
- Technical debts under X days

## In other words,

Coded, tested and documented
