# User Story Priorities

## General Definition

The priority level determines the relative importance and severity of an backlog item based on criteria such as urgency and impact. This helps the team respond appropriately, by allowing all team members to prioritize the right work and better understand the required time and effort to complete it.

## JIRA Service Management Default

In JIRA Service Management, issue priorities scale from:

- **Lowest** - Trivial problem with little or no impact on progress
- **Low** - Minor problem or easily worked around
- **Medium** - Has the potential to affect progress
- **High** - Serious problem that could block progress
- **Highest** - The problem will block progress

## **Selecting a priority level**

The team should have into account measurements like **urgency** and **impact** when selecting the priority level of a backlog item. It’s also worth nothing that the priority can be changed at any time.

**Impact** measures the effect of an incident on a business' processes. Impact is generally based on how your quality of service is affected.

**Urgency** measures the time for an incident to significantly impact your business.

For example, a high impact incident may have low urgency if the impact will not affect the business until the end of the financial year.

## Team Decisions

The team has decided to prioritize the backlog items with the default prioritization system found in JIRA Service Management.

We can manually assign priority levels, or create an impact urgency priority matrix and use automation to automatically assign priorities for us. For now, we’ll create manually.
