# Story Points

## General Definition

The overall effort required to fully implement a product backlog item and be measured in story points. Team members allocate story points based on the amount of effort, the work complexity, and the risk or uncertainty involved.

These points are assigned to more effectively break down work into smaller pieces, which reduces uncertainty and gradually helps the team grasp how much they can achieve in a given amount of time. These points also build consensus and a sense of commitment to the solution.

However, story points aren’t a measurement of productivity. Instead, teams should use story points to understand the amount of the work and the prioritization of each user story.

There are multiple techniques to determine how to estimate, such as: Planning poker and Relative Estimation.

## Planning Poker method

The team will:

- Choose an item from the backlog
- Have a quick discussion about the chosen backlog item
- Have each member estimate the Story Points
- Have each member hold up a card with the number that reflects their estimate

If there isn’t a consensus about the estimate, the team should take some time to understand the reasoning behind different the estimates.

## Relative Estimation method

The team will:

- First identify the smallest story and assign one story point to it (primary reference story)
- Relate any other stories to the smallest story (1 Story Point) and identify other numbers
- Keep a list of those reference stories for future reference

In most cases, a story point uses one of the following scales: 1,2,4,8,16; X-Small, Small, Medium, Large, Extra-Large (*known as “T-Shirt Sizing”*); Fibonacci sequence: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21.

**Benefits**:

- Less time, and easy to refine
- Can be explained easily and expectations can be justified
- People are better at relative estimation than absolute estimation, more accurate
- It gets better with time
- More team-centric than time-centric (like absolute estimation)

## Team Decisions

The team has decided to apply the **relative estimation** method with the scale: **1,2,4,8,16**.

No backlog item should take more than 16 hours to complete, hence, we’ve decided that the maximum is **16 Story Points**. After all, it’s difficult to estimate the amount of effort for larger items of work with significant accuracy. Hence, any backlog item that exceeds the 16 Story Points should be broken down in smaller components and re-estimated.

For items deeper in the backlog, the team members should only give a quick, rough estimation. After all, the requirements may change with time and these backlog items will be adapted to include these changes.
