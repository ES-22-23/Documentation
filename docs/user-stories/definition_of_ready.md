# Definition of Ready

## General Definition

The definition of ready (DoR) is when all the conditions that a user story must meet (prior to being accepted into the upcoming sprint) are defined and clarified for the product owner. This enables the creation of ready backlog items.

The focus is on making sure backlog items have enough clarity so that the team members can commit to delivering items within a sprint. Clarity means that the team members fully understand what they’re asked to deliver.

Poorly thought-out or the lack of definition of ready can and will cause the team to spend more time on trying to figure out what they are supposed to create than actually creating.

Many benefits come from applying this definition, such as providing the team with an explicit agreement to refuse or “push back” on poorly defined backlog items (*User Stories).

The Product Owner uses the definition of ready as a guide when preparing for user stories for upcoming sprints. The team members use the definition of ready as a checklist to make sure that the user story can be worked on and that there is an increased chance of success in delivering the completed user story.

## Definition Changes

The definition of ready can evolve over time and match the different development stages of the software product. For example, the team members can require something that isn’t normally provided or requested, such as screen mockups. We add it to definition of ready and, later on, if the team members no longer need these criteria, we can and should remove it from the definition.

## INVEST Matrix

The definition of ready is generally based on the INVEST matrix.  In other words, a ready user story should be:

- “I” ndependent (of all others)
- “N” egotiable (not a specific contract for features)
- “V” aluable (incremental)
- “E” stimable (to a good approximation)
- “S” mall (to fit within an iteration)
- “T” estable (in principle, even if there isn’t a test for it yet)

## Mandatory Criteria

- Well-defined User Story
- Acceptance criteria defined
    - “Given, when, then”
- User defined
- Amount of effort sized by the team (User Story Points)
- Priority sized by the team (User Story Priorities)
- Product Owner accepts the User Story as ready

## Optional Criteria

- Screen Mockups - UI
- Non-Functional requirements defined
- Performance criteria identified (by calculating the deliverables and effectiveness of the scrum team)

## Definition of Ready for Sprints

- Prioritized sprint backlog
- Defects, user stories and other work the team has committed to are contained in the sprint backlog
- No hidden work
- All team members have calculated their individual capacity for the sprint
- All users stories meet the definition of Ready
