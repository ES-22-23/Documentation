# Personal Information Updates
----------------------------------------
By accessing the account page in the client dashboard, the client is able to view their account details. 

One of the functionalities the a SecCom client is provided with as well is the ability to update it's own information.
In order for the user to do so, we implemented a page, acessible via the Account page, for that end.

The user will be able to fill out a form, where he will be able to change it's first and last name, as well as it's email.

This information will then be used to update the client's instance on Keycloak.

Password changes cannot be performed via this method, as it's impossible to perform the change on the newer Keycloak versions.
